## About Me üòÅ

**Electrical Engineering sophomore at NYU.** My focus is networks and communication systems, and the semiconductor technologies behind them. Research comes first, leadership will follow. After my Bachelor's will be a Master's. Long-term, I will be heading to law school, specializing in Corporate Law with a focus on Mergers and Acquisitions. The objective is straightforward: combine technical proficiency with legal strategy.

My GitHub space will be used to publish the projects I'm working on to develop my programming skills, applying them to problem-solving in network systems and optimization. It‚Äôs all part of the continuous learning process that underpins both my technical and strategic ambitions.
